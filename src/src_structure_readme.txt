Rules for writing code:

1. Use Python 3.5+
2. Use clear, standard indentation according to PEP conventions
3. When defining a function or class:
	- Write in comments about the functionalities
	- Define Inputs and Outputs and their types

eg.

def quadratic(x: float) -> float:
    """
    param x: Value to be raised to the power 2
    return: x raised to the power 2
    """
    return x**2
